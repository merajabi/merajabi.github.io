## A Simple C++ Object Relational MAP

### Features

simple and intuitive interface
support for C++98 to be compatible with old embedded toolchains
automatic code generation

### Notice

The project is still naive it currently support operations on distinct tables no join implemented yet. 
As Donald Knuth stated premature optimization is the root of all evil, so nothing is optimized yet.
